This is the page we see when we access the service:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-1.png">

Going through the page cookies, I found this:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-2.png">

I tried to set the *flag* cookie to *False* and send the form.
As a result, the old form is replaced by the following:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-3.png">

After several tries, I found out that the correct username was *root*.

I sent the form again:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-6.png">


In the list of cookies, I now see this:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/codefest17/cookie-4.png">

The values of the *pass* cookie is an md5 hash for the word *aunty*.
I type it as a password, and I find out it's the flag:
